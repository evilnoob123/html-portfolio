<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Business and Accounting degree graduate that has been working in Tech Consultancy and Product Management roles since 2017, in company sizes ranging from large MNCs to Series A Tech startups.</p>

<p>In 2024, I took a short detour from my career to experience entrepreneurship in F&B. Since then, I've co-founded a Gelato Cafe business that is operational at a passive pace, and also opened another F&B takeaway business with a unique concept, which I have sold off since.</p>

<p>Having worked in startups and entrepreneurial experience in small B2C businesses, I have a deeper understanding of the nuances in delivering new concepts from 0 to 1 through iterations and proof-of-concepts, as well as scaling such concepts from 1 to 10, while deftly prioritizing these together with short term and long term business objectives and profitability.</p>
